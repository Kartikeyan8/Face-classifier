# Face-classifier
So obviously I had to delete the datasets having my image.
so here the problem of having a null detector is still intact and I have to work on it.
moreover, the value of accuracy is quite high as the kind of images I took were of similar quality hence showing the deviation in the plot. I 
will try to optimize the solution.
